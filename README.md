# Intro

In the effort to become a better programmer, I will be doing the examples in the Cracking the Code Interview. This hopefully will prepare me for interviews and also strengthen my programming and engineering capabilities.

## Summary

Each Chapter has it's own tests and java code. The tests are written first, and then I write the code afterwards... I do test driven development, because I write code fast, and this mitigates me creating bugs.

## Why Java

I use it at work, and I'm tired of not being technically proficient in one language.

### How can I contribute?

Dont.
